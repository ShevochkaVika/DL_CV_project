This project is focused on the first part (preparation) for the project for the subject "deep learning for computer vision". 
image classification

This part includes:
- Dataset loading and preprocessing
- Data augmentation techniques

How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ShevochkaVika/DL_CV_project.git
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook project01_shevchenko.ipynb


Data Analysis
Dataset: The notebook processes an image classification dataset.
Data Augmentation: Includes transformations such as random flips, rotation, and color jittering.
Class Distribution: The dataset has been analyzed for class imbalance using visualizations.
